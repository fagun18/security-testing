# Software security-testing
A simple Python script that can be used to perform security testing on a software application:

This script uses the requests library in Python to perform various security tests on a software application. The script includes four test methods: test_sql_injection, test_xss, test_csrf, test_ssl_validation which test different types of security vulnerabilities. Each method sends a request to the application with payloads that are known to exploit the specific vulnerability and checks the response against expected output.

It's important to note that this is just an example and the actual test methods and their implementation will depend on the software you want to test. Also, it's important to note that this script is just a skeleton and it doesn't include the actual implementations of the methods, these methods should be implemented by the tester according to the software under test.

Additionally, you may want to consider using a more robust security testing framework like OWASP ZAP, Nessus or Metasploit for more advanced security testing.
